    <h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases as the size of the input grows. It helps determine how efficient an algorithm is, particularly when handling large datasets. A more efficient algorithm minimizes the time required to solve a problem.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory or space an algorithm uses as the input size increases. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) uses space that scales linearly with the input size, meaning the memory required increases as the input grows.</p>
